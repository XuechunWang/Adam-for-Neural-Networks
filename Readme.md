# Adam on Different Neural Networks with Pruning Methods

**You can see our poster in the "561 Project Poster.pptx"**

### General_Implement_SGD_Adam.ipynb

You can find the linear regression optimization program using SGD and Adam here.

### Neural_MNIST.ipynb

You can find the neural networks for MNIST here.

### pruning.py

You see the result fo pruned nerual networks by running "python pruning.py"

**Notice: Pytorch is required to run the codes above.**
